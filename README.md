### What is the Clear Web?
The **Clear Web** is the web we all know. It refers to information that can be accessed through any web browser, also known as the **World Wide Web**. By using the Clear Web, we are showing very important information about ourselves to the world. For example, every time we access a website with Google, we are showing our public IP address.<br>

> **World Wide Web:** worldwide computer network that works through the Internet and that allows the transmission of different types of data through the HTTP protocol.
> - **Hypertext:** text that contains links to other texts.
> - **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

Broadly speaking, we can say that the Clear Web is the web where we can find all the **indexed pages** like Facebook. A page is said to be indexed when it is known by web search engines, so that we can access it through these search engines.


### What is the Deep Web?
The **Deep Web** is the opposite of the Clear Web. It refers to all that information that cannot be accessed through conventional web browsers. Here we can find all kinds of pages, such as dynamic websites that are temporarily created to search a database or paywalled sites. We are talking about **non-indexed pages**.<br><br>
For example, all the files you have in Google Drive are on the Internet. This content cannot be accessed because it is private. So we can say that our Google Drive files cannot be indexed, because they are on the internet but cannot be accessed by simple search. But one interesting thing about the Deep Web is that there are some pages that can be accessed, despite not being indexed. All the pages that belong to this category are part of the **Dark Web**.


### What is the Dark Web?
The **Dark Web** is made up of pages that are intentionally hidden from search engines. To achieve this, **masked IP addresses** are used and can only be accessed through special web browsers. The most common extensions for these addresses are **.onion** and **.i2p**.

> **.onion:** refers to an anonymous IP address that can be accessed through the Tor Network to become part of the Deep Web.

But the **Dark Web** is not a thing in itself, but the content that you can find in different **Dark Nets**, which are each one of the special networks that can only be accessed with special software.
