### What is the Clear Web?
The **Clear Web** is the web we all know. This refers to information that can be accessed through any web browser, also known as the **World Wide Web**. By using the Clear Web, we are showing very important information about ourselves to the world. For example, every time we access a website with Google, we are showing our public IP address.<br>

> **World Wide Web:** worldwide computer network that works through the Internet and that allows the transmission of different types of data through the HTTP protocol.
> - **Hypertext:** text that contains links to other texts.
> - **HTTP:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

Broadly speaking, we can say that the Clear Web is the web where we can find all the indexed pages like Facebook. A page is said to be indexed when it is known by web search engines, so that we can access it through these search engines.
